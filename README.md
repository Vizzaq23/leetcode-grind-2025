# LeetCode Grind 2025

This repository contains over 150 LeetCode problems that I’ve solved in Python and C as part of my preparation for high-level software engineering internships at top tech and quant firms (e.g., Jane Street, Citadel, Palantir).

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Trees
- Graphs (BFS/DFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Why This Repo Exists
The goal is to:
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Build speed and accuracy for interviews
- Create a public portfolio that reflects consistent problem-solving skills

## Languages Used
- Python
- C

## How It's Structured
- Each topic has its own folder
- Files are named by problem (e.g., `max-subarray.py`, `climbing-stairs.c`)
- Most files include brief comments or explanations
